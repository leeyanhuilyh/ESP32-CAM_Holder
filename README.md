# ESP32-CAM_Holder
This repository contains the 3D files required to print the ESP32-CAM holder

The v5 version is a stable, tried and tested holder. It is adviable to print the model in two parts instead of one. 

The v10 version is a compact, single-piece version but does not offer full support of the ESP32-CAM.

In both cases, it is advisable to utilise sticky tape to hold the boards in place if need be.
